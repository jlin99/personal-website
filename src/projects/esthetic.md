Esthetic is a virtual closet app that will feature an ML algorithm to automatically tag your clothes for you after taking a picture. 

This is a personal project my friend, Steve Docto, and I took on. We were focused on learning and gaining experience so we chose a topic we are both interested in, fashion. Steve was telling me about how he looked at a few virtual closet apps but there weren't really that many marketed for men. We decided to fill that niche for ourselves.

I conducted three user interviews with friends who used virtual closet apps to see if there was anything we can improve on in our iteration. One of the biggest complaints was how annoying it was to maintain your closet. While we can't take pictures of clothes for users, we thought the next best thing would be to streamline tagging clothes with the use of an ML algorithm. The algorithm is currently being developed on AWS SageMaker. 

I also created mockup screens for Steve to build on. We wanted a clean, minimal design that's a little more streetwear oriented as that is where our interests lie in fashion. Here is how the app currently looks.
